#### add list for user and dealer so it can count cards### NEXT, make new file count4_blackjack
#### add comment to count and this code!!!!!!!!
## in count program: add elif statement when flipped over card in list to convert to 0
#if over 21 say bust and stop 
#reshuffle
#when to reshuffle
#dealer can only hit on 16 check rule
